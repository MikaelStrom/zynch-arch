Generic makefile for creating Zynq boot images with Arch Linux on SD card.
This build gives a working USB host interface.

1. Make sure dtc is not installed on your system, as u-boot build may mixup local and system headers.

2. Run "scripts/get-trees.sh" to get all sources required. Takes a while, have a coffee.

3. Edit Makefile:
	- set VER to latest Vivado version.
	- set UBOOT_DEV to target board.
	- Optionally, update path to .bit and .hdf files. Simple ZedBoard and MicroZed examples provided for test.

4. Run "make" to build. Have another coffee.

5. Mount SD card as follows:
	- Boot partition on sdcard/boot, must be FAT32
	- Root file system partition on sdcard/fs, must be EXT4

6. Run "make sdboot" to install boot files.

7. Run "make sdfs" to install file system.

8. Unmount sd card and boot up the board.

9. Login with user/password root/root or alarm/alarm.

For reasons unknown to me, uenv.txt on the SD card sometimes fail to set proper environment in u-boot. 
If boot fails, enter this in u-boot:

Zynq> setenv bootargs 'console=ttyPS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait'
Zynq> setenv sdboot 'echo Copying Linux from SD to RAM... && mmcinfo && fatload mmc 0 0x3000000 ${kernel_image} && fatload mmc 0 0x2A00000 ${devicetree_image} && bootm 0x3000000 - 0x2A00000'
Zynq> boot

Note that it might be necessary to descend all trees and do "git fetch" for a new release.

Tested on ZedBoard and MicroZed with Vivado 2017.4 and current Arch Linux (as of March 2018). Builds on 2017.2  but not tested in HW.
