1. Run "scripts/get-trees.sh" to get all sources required. Takes a while, have a coffee.

2. Edit Makefile: 
	- set VER to latest Vivado version (only 2017.4 tested).
	- set UBOOT_DEV to correct board.
	- Optionally, update path to .bit and .hdf files. Simple ZedBoard example provided for test.

3. Run "make" to build all parts. Have another coffee.

4. Mount SD card as follows:
	- Boot partition on sdcard/boot, must be FAT 
	- file system on sdcard/fs, must be EXT4

5. Run "make sdboot" to install boot files.

6. Run "make sdfs" to install file system.

7. Unmount sd card and boot up the board.

Note that it might be necessary to descend all trees and do "git fetch" for a new relase.
